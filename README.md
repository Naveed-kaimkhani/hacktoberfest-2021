## Get contributingü§©

__Note: One must read [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](https://github.com/ShivamYadav-Coding/hacktoberfest-2021/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before starting work on any issue__

First things first, In order to contribute you have to create a Pull Request from your forked repo which is a remote clone of this upstream repository.<br>
<img width="520" alt="pic3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69135897/135800140-b70ee453-9b53-48e9-bac2-62258678cf80.png">

1. Click this button at the top of screen to fork this repo, don't forget to star the repository!:<br>
![pic4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69135897/135800163-8e87a0f3-1643-4b54-aac5-2cbd81edfffa.jpg)

2. Now head over to the forked repository and copy the clone HTTPS URL:<br>

3. Next up clone the forked repo on to the local machine using:<br>

    ``git clone <copied-fork-link>``

4. Run these command to add remote origin
   ```
   git remote add origin <The url of forked github repository>
   ```
   If this command give message like git remote already exist then run this command
   ```
   git remote set-url origin <The url of forked github repository>
   ```
   
5. It is critical to keep your [forked repository in sync the upstream](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-git-repository/) repository so merge conflicts can be avoided:
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ShivamYadav-Coding/hacktoberfest-2021.git
    git fetch upstream
    git pull upstream main
    ```
    
6. Create a seperate branch to work on:<br>

    The branch name must be selected according to the issue<br>

    ``git checkout -b <branch-name>``

7. Contributors must follow the directory structure guidelines:
    * All files must be kept in a directory.
    * Directory name must resemble the issue assigned.
    * Based on the language used, create a directory inside the language directory.
    * Example: If I am writing in `Python` I will create a directory inside `Python` directory.
    * In case a project is being contributed make sure to add the files inside a directory(name according to project) which in turn must be placed inside the `Projects` directory.
    * Changes done by you will not affect existing structure of the project.
    * Add a README.md with your name and link to github profile using \[your-name](link-to-profile)

8. After the contribution work is ready go ahead and add it to staging area:<br>

    ``git add -A``

9. Now it is time to commit your changes and sync these changes to forked repo:<br>

    ``git commit -m <your_message>``

    ``git push origin <branch-name>`` 


10. Issue a [pull request](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request) from forked repo to this repo:<br>
    * Head over to `Pull Request` tab in the forked repo and click on `New Pull Request`
